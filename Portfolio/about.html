        <p>Jeff McCommas is a skilled Front End Developer with a BIG focus on mobile integration and Responsive Web

        <p>Design isn’t only about creating beautiful aesthetics. Commonly overlooked is that web developement is
            problem solving. Because design is a problem solving activity, you can measure how good a design is by how
            well it solves a particular problem. When I am hired, my role is to come up with clean code that solves the
            problem. I am a developer who matches up well with my clients because if have a passion for the content and
            can think at a high design level.</p>

        <p>Good developers are trained in conceptual and high-value visual thinking to deliver messages with impact. My
            mission is to consistently outdo my previous work. As a developer for many years I look closely at the goals
            and needs of the user and choose a style that best fits both the client and users’ requirements. I
            understand what technology is necessary and when, enabling me to produce the best results as quickly as
            possible.</p>
